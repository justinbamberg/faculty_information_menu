# Faculty Dashboard Widget

This widget contains expandable sections for:

- Faculty Training
- D2L Webinars
- Course Merge Request
- Help Desk
- Student Support System
- Attendance Tracking
- Last Date of Attendance Info
- Submit Grades By:
- Add a ZZStudent (Demo Student)
- Create Sandbox Course

## Notes
Note:
Remember, for some of these features, permission changes will need to be made to allow faculty to create or do some of the tasks.

When creating widgets, D2L only allows inline CSS unless you are linking to a CSS file in a different folder. Otherwise, it will be stripped out if you use <style></style> blocks.
